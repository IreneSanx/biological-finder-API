# biological-finder-API

This is the API created for the deployment of a technology demonstrator that allows the search of information on genes, proteins and diseases in the GenBank, UniProt and OMIM databases, respectively. 

The API has been developed using FastAPI in Python.

FastAPI is a Python framework designed to create API endpoints quickly, with fast execution as well.
